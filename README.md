### What is this?
A very simple new tab page extension meant to stay out of your way while still being a pleasant distraction for those who need something to look at while they think.

### Can I change the types of backgrounds I look at?
You can, just hit the reload button and you should get a new image!    
Don't wanna see the beaches and oceans anymore? You can go to the settings side panel and change the search query!
